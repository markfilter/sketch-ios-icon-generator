# Sketch: Apple Icon Generator

Sketch is an awesome application, but the default iOS icon template is not powerful enough to be "Swifty" for every project.  This is a boilerplate file that gives designers and developers a quick start on getting their icons ready for import into the xcassets folder.

### How to use
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open the file up in Sketch.
3. Find the symbols page, add your designs in the symbol area.
4. View the changes dynamically throughout the rest of the page structure.
5. Export into a folder and drag & drop into your xcassets folder.

### Note
Unfortunately, Xcode is not smart enough to place all of the images in the correct location, so, you may need to manually drag some of the images into the correct location.
